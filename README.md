Hi Adam,

Thanks for your letter. I am happy that you have many friends. I have 

many friends, some live in Hanoi and some live in my hometown. My best 

friend is Nam, he is 22 years old, he studies at Vietnam National 

University of Agriculture. He studies Engineering. He is from Ho Chi 

Minh, and he likes listening to music and reading books. We often go 

shopping and play football, it is really fun. Nam is very important. When 

I am sad, Nam asks me to go out, and I feel better. I will miss him if we 

don't meet often. So we often meet at the weekend. Would you like to meet 

him? Take care and write soon,

Harry

Hi George,

I’m writing about Friday. You wanted to go to the cinema together, 

remember? I’m sorry, but I can’t come because my grandparents are coming 

to visit. You could come to my house on Sunday instead? We could watch 

the new Bond movie.

Hi Jenna,

I went to an amazing new café in town last weekend. 

They serve delicious pizzas and pasta. The best thing is the desserts –

the chocolate cake is delicious! 

Are you free on Friday? We could go there together if you like.

Hi Tom,

I’ve just got back from my holiday in Spain. It was amazing! The beaches 

were fantastic, and I loved the food. The people were friendly, too. 

Would you like to see my photos? I can email them to you if you want.

Hi George,

I’m sorry to hear about your problems with your family. I usually get on 

really well with my parents, although we don’t agree about everything and 

we sometimes have arguments. I’ve only got one brother, and we are very 

different. We don’t have much in common, but I’m fond of him and we don’t 

often argue. I think you should avoid having serious discussions with 

your family if you never agree. Brothers and sisters can be difficult, 

but just be patient. I’m sure you’ll get on better when they grow up. 

Take care and write soon,

Adele

Dear Jenna,

How are you? Long time no see! I have many friends. As my mother always 

says, friends are important in our life. As I spend most of my time at 

work, I have plenty of friends there. Being friends, we can help each 

other. if we get some difficulties at work. If I have a personal problem, 

friends are important in that moment. They can advise me about life. So, 

we can't live without friends. I'm happy to be your friend also So, I'm 

looking forward to hearing more about your friend.

Best wishes

Makena
